## About

PERSÖN AI is an innovative and robust Artificial Intelligence model designed for advanced human recognition in security camera applications. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, PERSÖN AI goes beyond simple motion detection, providing highly accurate and reliable identification of individuals within camera feeds. This project aims to enhance security systems by offering real-time, intelligent monitoring capabilities, enabling quicker response times and more effective threat assessment.

## Features

* **High-Accuracy Human Detection:** Utilizes advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to precisely identify human presence in various environmental conditions.
* **Individual Recognition:** Distinguishes and identifies unique individuals based on configurable parameters (e.g., facial features, gait analysis, clothing attributes).
* **Real-time Processing:** Optimized for live video streams, providing immediate insights and alerts.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle multiple camera feeds concurrently and integrate seamlessly with existing security infrastructure.
* **Privacy-Aware Design (Optional/Configurable):** Features can be configured to prioritize privacy, allowing for anonymized tracking or consent-based recognition.
* **Alert System:** Integrates with notification systems (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) to alert designated personnel of identified individuals or anomalies.
* **Database Integration:** Capable of linking identified individuals to pre-existing databases for authorized access or watchlist monitoring.
* **Robustness to Occlusion & Lighting:** Engineered to perform effectively even with partial obstructions or challenging lighting conditions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose one based on the model's backend)
* OpenCV
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* CUDA (for GPU acceleration, highly recommended for performance)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/PERSÖN-AI.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/PERSÖN-AI.git)
    cd PERSÖN-AI
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download pre-trained models (if applicable):**
    *(Instructions here would depend on whether you provide pre-trained weights. If so, provide a link or script to download them.)*

    ```bash
    # Example: python download_models.py
    ```

## Usage

To run PERSÖN AI with a sample video feed or a live camera stream:

1.  **For a sample video file:**

    ```bash
    python main.py --source_type video --video_path path/to/your/video.mp4
    ```

2.  **For a live webcam feed:**

    ```bash
    python main.py --source_type webcam --camera_id 0 # 0 for default webcam, adjust if needed
    ```

3.  **For a network camera (RTSP stream):**

    ```bash
    python main.py --source_type rtsp --rtsp_url rtsp://user:pass@ip_address:port/stream
    ```

* **Real-time Visualization:** The system will display a window showing the camera feed with detected and recognized individuals highlighted.
* **Log Output:** Console output will show recognition events and confidence scores.
